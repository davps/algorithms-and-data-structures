## Tools 

#Drawing a graph on the browser

This is a specialized tool for graph drawing 

	http://www.samsarin.com/project/dagre-d3/latest/demo/interactive-demo.html

You can do, for example:

	```
	digraph {
	    C;
	    B -> C;
	    B -> D;
	 }
	```	

Draw.io is more manual but useful in some cases
